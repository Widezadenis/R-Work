##Create a visualization that compares market segments between city hotels and resort hotels
create a cleaned and labeled version and save it as a .png file to include in a presentation.

ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +  (Indicates which dataset to pull data from)
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = market_segment)) + (creates a bar chart mapping maket_segment on the x-axis)
  facet_wrap(~hotel) +  (creates different plot for each hotel type)
  labs(title = "Market Segments: City Vs Resort Hotels")",   (adds a title for viewers)
  caption = paste0("Data from: ", mindate, " to ", maxdate) (adds a caption at the bottom of screen to identify when the data is from)
            x = "Market Segments",
            y = "Number of Bookings")  (adds labels to the x and y axis) + 
  ggsave('hotel_booking_chart.png', width=7,
       height=7) (saves to pc as a 7x7 png file)

mindate <- min(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year)
maxdate <- max(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_year) (finds out when the data is from)
