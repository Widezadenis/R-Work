## Manipulating your data
##Arranges the data by most lead time to least lead time to focus on booking made in advance
  hotel_bookings %>% 
  arrange(desc(lead_time))  

##Finds the maximum, minimum, and average lead times
 min_max_avg_lead_time <- hotel_bookings %>% 
  summarize(max_lead = max(lead_time), 
            min_lead = min(lead_time), 
            avg_lead = mean(lead_time))

## Finds the average lead time before booking is for just city hotels
hotel_bookings_city <- hotel_bookings %>% 
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") %>% 
  summarize(mean_lead = mean(lead_time))

#Finds the maximum and minimum lead time for hotels and how they are different from resort hotels
hotel_summary <- hotel_bookings %>% 
  group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarize(max_lead = max(lead_time), 
            min_lead = min(lead_time), 
            avg_lead = mean(lead_time))
