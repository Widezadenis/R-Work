# Find which market segments generate the largest number of bookings, and where these bookings are made (city hotels or resort hotels).

create a bar chart showing each hotel type and market segment.
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hotel, fill = market_segment))

create a separate plot for each market segment
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hotel, fill = market_segment)) +
  facet_wrap(~market_segment)

create a plot that shows the relationship between lead time and guests traveling with children for online bookings at city hotels

Start by filtering the data 
Online_TA_City_Hotels <- hotel_bookings %>% 
  filter(hotel == 'City Hotel') %>% 
  filter(Market_segment == 'Online TA')

Create plot
ggplot( data = Online_TA_City_Hotels) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))
