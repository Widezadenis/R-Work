  arrange(hotel_bookings, desc(lead_time))  

#Find out the maximum and minimum lead times
 max(hotel_bookings$lead_time) 
  min(hotel_bookings$lead_time)

# Get the average lead time for booking
mean(otel_bookings$lead_time)

# filter average lead time by city hotels 
hotel_bookings_city <- hotel_bookings %>%
